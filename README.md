# Gatsby.js + Cloudflare Workers üå•üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

This is an example project showing how you can build a website with [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and serve it at the edge using [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com).

## Why?

Cloudflare Workers allows developers to write and deploy applications at the edge. When a user requests your site, your Worker will serve it directly from one of our [175+ data centers](http://bit.ly/gatsby-example-cf-network) around the world. Static sites are perfect fit for building extremely fast, high availability sites, and Cloudflare's default caching behavior will result in a high cache rate for the bulk of your site. The result is an easy-to-manage site, hosted [at the edge](http://bit.ly/gatsby-example-cf-edge-server), with the ability for further customization via editing the provided [Workers function](https://github.com/signalnerve/gatsby-cloudflare-workers/blob/master/index.js).

## How it works

1. The website is built locally using Gatsby (for development instructions, see [`GATSBY_README.md`](https://github.com/signalnerve/gatsby-cloudflare-workers/blob/master/GATSBY_README.md))
2. The site is built and uploaded into Workers KV - see the "Setup" section
3. A Cloudflare Worker script runs at your domain, and takes the requested path (e.g. `/about`) and requests it from Workers KV.

## Setup

You can use this repository as a template to build your own static site, using the `wrangler generate` command. If you haven't installed Wrangler yet, try our [Quick Start guide](https://workers.cloudflare.com/docs/quickstart/cli-setup/) for installing Wrangler, and getting up and running with Cloudflare Workers! Once you've done that, you can pass this repository to the `generate` command to make a new project locally:

```shell
wrangler generate my-gatsby-site https://github.com/signalnerve/gatsby-cloudflare-workers
```

Configure your deployment by opening up `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
name = "gatsby-on-workers"
type = "webpack"
account_id = "$accountId"
private = false
kv-namespaces = ["STATIC_CONTENT"]
```

## Development

Begin by installing the dependencies for this project (and additionally, install `wrangler` and `gatsby` globally if you don't already have them):

```
npm install -g @cloudflare/wrangler gatsby
npm install
```

Develop your site locally:

```
gatsby develop
```

When you're ready to deploy, build and deploy to GitHub:

```
npm run deploy
```

This builds the site (`gatsby build`), uploads it to Workers KV, and deploys the newest version of your Workers function.
